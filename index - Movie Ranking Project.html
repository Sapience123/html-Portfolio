<h1>Best Movies - Movie Review by Victor</h1>
<h2>Top Movies So Far</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Trillion Game</h3>
</p>This a japanese movie. It falls under suspense, comedy and it is a really interesting movie. It gives you some kind of insight into 
what happens in the business world,life after school and other related scenarios. It centers around two friends who bumo into each other
after graduation then set out to conquer the business world.</p>
<h3>First Love</h3>
</p>This, of course, is a romantic comedy, but not just any romantic comedy, it is actually one of the best romantic movies released. It is 
about two high school lovers who set out to pursue their dreams after graduation. Unfortunately, they have an argument which causes the lady
to lose her memory, but inspite of the memory loss, she falls in love with him again and they end up doing their dream jobs together.</p>
<h3>Spy Family</h3>
<p>Now, this list would not be complete without what I refer to as the best anime of all time. It is important to note that I do not really watch 
lots of anime, therefore, this may not really be the best review for animes. Nevertheless, it is an awesome anime and it is worth watching.
The anime is about a family of three, the father being a spy, the mother, an assasin, and the daughter, a psychic, they all try as much as
they can to keep their identities from each other.</p>
<h3>Brooklyn 99</h3>
</p>If you want to be glued to your tv while you laugh out loud like crazy as you lose track of time, then Broollyn 99 is your kind of movie.
The entire movie is about a set of friends in the police force and series of events and battles they had to face and overcome. I feel this 
movie actually satisfies the thirst that can crave in once your done watching friends, and you just can't find something good enough to match
the high energy that comes with 'friends'.</p>
